Learning motion scale for monocular visual odometry

Visual odometry is problem of camera motion recovery from the images taken by it.  There is a plethora of methods that attempt to solve this problem.  They may be classfified as stereo and monocular.  While monocular methods allow to recover a full 6-DOF motion they have a downside of a setup complexity (e.g. hardware camera sync, large amounts of data, etc.).  Monocular setups are attractive due to their inherent simplicity, but lack motion scale estimate.  We argue that the scale information is readily available in the natural scenes.  We propose to explore the ways to use the modern machine learning methods to predict a motion scale in monocular case. The availability of such methods would render monocular methods even more attractive and facilitate decision making in autonomous vehicle case.
